					REFUNDS ARE ONLY GIVEN TO ITEMS THAT ARE DEFECTIVE OR

				</h2>
				<div>
					As a wholesale company, we offer very low prices for
					customers to resell to make a profit. As such, our profits
					per item too are very low. Furthermore, shipping the item
					back to us will generally cost more than the refunded
					item(s).
				</div>

				<h4> Inquiry Email</h4>
				<div>
					If a product you receive is defective or damaged, send a
					picture of it to our email: classyjewelryws@gmail.com with
					"refund inquiry" in the subject line. Along with pictures of
					items as well as a link to your order or the order number
					and your contact details such as your phone number or email.
					Emails should be sent within 7 days of receiving your
					package. We will respond to the same email whether said item
					is eligible for a refund
				</div>

				<h4>Out of State</h4>
				<div>
					We plan to order jewelry parts so that you will be able to
					fix said items. New parts will be shipped along with your
					next order in order to prevent extra costs.
				</div>

				<h4>At the store</h4>
				<div>
					After sending a refund inquiry email, you will have 1 month
					to bring back the item to our store. Please have the refund
					inquiry email opened prior to avoid delays. We will first
					attempt to repair each item and if it is irreparable, we
					will offer a refund or exchange.
				</div>

				<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
				<div>
					If more than 7 days have passed since your purchase was
					received or more than 30 days have passed since you placed
					an email, unfortunately we canâ€™t offer you a refund.
				</div>

				<h4>Non eligible items</h4>
				<div>
					Any item on sale, items sold at $1 or below, sanitary goods,
					flammable liquids, as well as used items are not eligible
					for refunds.
