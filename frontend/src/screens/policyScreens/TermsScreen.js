			entity listed below (“Alibaba.com” or “we”), which supplements the
			Alibaba.com Transaction Services Agreement regarding your use of the
			Alibaba.com Supplemental Services (as defined below) provided to
			registered members of the www.alibaba.com online site (“Alibaba.com
			Site”). If you are registered or resident outside mainland China,
			you are contracting with Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private
			Limited (incorporated in Singapore with Company Reg. No.
			200720572D). If you are registered or resident in mainland China,
			you are contracting with Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private
			Limited and its affiliate(s) which provides technical support in
			connection with the transaction services utilizing its strengths in
			network technologies, etc. 1. Acceptance of Terms 1.1 You
			acknowledge that you have read this Agreement prior to your use of
			Alibaba.com Supplemental Services. Each time you use Alibaba.com
			Supplemental Services you confirm that you agree to be bound by the
			terms and conditions of this Agreement and any subsequent amendments
			or modifications as may be made from time to time. 1.2 As some or
			part of the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services may be supported and
			provided by affiliates of Alibaba.com, Alibaba.com may delegate some
			of the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services to its affiliates. 1.3 We
			may amend this Agreement at any time by posting an updated version
			at www.alibaba.com (the “Alibaba.com Site”). The updated version of
			this Agreement shall take effect immediately upon posting. By
			continuing to use the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services, you agree
			to that the amended terms will apply to you. 2. Alibaba.com
			Supplemental Services 2.1 The “Alibaba.com Supplemental Services”
			are services provided by Alibaba.com and our affiliates to
			facilitate payments in connection with the online transactions
			concluded on and through the Alibaba.com Sites. These transactions
			(“Online Transactions”) are subject to the Alibaba.com Transaction
			Services Agreement . Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, the
			capitalized terms shall have the same meanings as used in the
			Alibaba.com Transaction Services Agreement. 2.2 The Alibaba.com
			Supplemental Services are only available to the registered members
			of the Alibaba.com Sites (“Users”). A User who purchases or acquires
			any product or service in an Online Transaction is referred to also
			as a “Buyer”, and a User who sells or provides any product or
			service in an Online Transaction is also referred to as a “Seller”.
			If your subscription to any membership services of the Alibaba.com
			Sites expires or is terminated for any reason, you are not eligible
			to use the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services to conclude online
			transactions on Alibaba.com Sites. In addition, Alibaba.com is not
			obliged to provide the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services where the
			bank account designated by a Seller in an Online Transaction to
			receive the transaction price has not been verified and confirmed by
			Alibaba.com and our affiliates. 2.3 Alibaba.com shall have the right
			to refuse to provide the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services for any
			Online Transaction if (a) the Online Transaction does not satisfy
			the terms and conditions in the Alibaba.com Transaction Services
			Agreement or the other applicable terms, rules and policies
			concerning Alibaba.com’s transaction services under the Alibaba.com
			Transaction Services Agreement in accordance with Alibaba.com’s
			instructions or (b) if Alibaba.com has reason to believe that the
			Online Transaction may violate any laws, rules or regulations or may
			otherwise subject Alibaba.com or any of our affiliates to liability.
			2.4 You agree that Alibaba.com shall have the sole and absolute
			discretion to remit funds subject to the terms of this Agreement. 3.
			Alibaba.com Supplemental Services for Online Transactions 3.1 Buyer
			of an Online Transaction shall pay the full transaction price listed
			for the Online Transaction to the Seller through the Alibaba.com
			Website or Alipay website unless another option is made available
			directly by Alibaba.com on the Alibaba.com Site. When using
			Alibaba.com to submit payment for an Alibaba.com Online Transaction,
			payments are processed through accounts owned by Alibaba.com or one
			of its affiliates and/or a registered third party service provider
			acting on Alibaba.com’s behalf. The funds are received for the
			Seller in accordance with the Alibaba.com Transaction Services
			Agreement. The Seller agrees that the Buyer’s full payment of the
			transaction price listed for the Online Transaction to Alibaba.com
			constitutes final payment to the Seller and Buyer’s payment
			obligation for the Online Transaction is fully satisfied upon
			receipt of funds by Alibaba.com’s account. The payment must be made
			in US Dollar or any other currencies as supported by Alibaba.com
			from time to time. 3.2 Upon receipt of the Buyer’s payment,
			Alibaba.com shall promptly notify Alibaba.com Sites of the details
			of the payment. Alibaba.com shall also monitor and keep safe custody
			of the received funds and shall not release the funds unless an
			event set forth in clause 3.3 below occurs. 3.3 Alibaba.com shall
			retain the funds received in connection with an Online Transaction
			unless, as agreed between Seller and Alibaba.com, any of the
			following events occurs: (a) in case of the successful completion of
			the Online Transaction upon Buyer’s confirmation, all the funds will
			be remitted to Seller; (b) in case of absence of the Buyer‘s
			confirmation of receipt of the goods within the time limit
			prescribed by Seller and as agreed by Alibaba.com, all the funds
			will be remitted to Seller; (c) in case of the cancellation of the
			Online Transaction, all the funds will be refunded to the Buyer; (d)
			in case of any settlement agreement reached by Buyer and Seller, the
			funds will be disposed of in accordance with such settlement
			agreement; (e) in case that a dispute in relation to Transaction
			Services has been submitted to Alibaba.com Sites for Alibaba.com’s
			determination and Alibaba.com’s determination has become final and
			binding according to clause 10 of the Alibaba.com Transaction
			Services Agreement, the funds will be disposed in accordance with
			Alibaba.com’s determination; or (f) if Alibaba.com or our affiliates
			receive any order, ruling, award, or judgment from a competent
			court, arbitration tribunal or authority which directs us to release
			the funds, the funds will be disposed of in accordance with such
			order, ruling, award, or judgment. Alibaba.com is not holding any
			funds on behalf of the Buyer, or in any escrow or trust
			relationship. The seller has requested that the settlement of funds
			to the Seller be delayed as provided in this clause 3.3. 3.4 You
			acknowledge that Alibaba.com may also provide a buyer protection
			plan for certain Online Transactions. In case of Seller who has been
			offered to subscribe to the buyer protection plan, upon entering
			into a separate agreement with Alibaba.com, Seller may be required
			to provide deposits using the methods as designated by Alibaba.com
			on the Alibaba.com Sites to secure Seller’s due performance of
			obligations under the relevant buyer protection plan. Seller agrees
			to permit and hereby authorize Alibaba.com, which in turn instructs
			Alibaba.com to deduct, withhold and dispose of any deposits provided
			in accordance with the terms under the relevant buyer protection
			plan. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the protection afforded to
			you under a buyer protection plan applies to those Online
			Transactions where the Seller subscribed to such plan and the
			purchase falls within the buyer protection plan’s scope. Services
			described under clause 3.3 of this Agreement will not be applicable
			to you if Seller subscribed to the buyer protection plan and such
			plan already covers your purchase. 3.5 When releasing any funds,
			Alibaba.com shall have the right to deduct any financial charges or
			service fees due and payable to Alibaba.com (if any) in such amount
			as instructed by Alibaba.com pursuant to the agreement between
			Seller and Alibaba.com. 3.6 In the event that the Buyer makes
			payment in a currency that is different from the currency stated in
			the transaction price of the Online Transaction, any refund made by
			Alibaba.com to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in
			the currency used by the Buyer in the Online Transaction, at the
			exchange rate utilized by Alibaba.com to convert from the currency
			stated in the transaction price as at the date of refund (or such
			other applicable date), less any applicable charges or fees set out
			in Clause 3.5 of this Agreement. Due to currency fluctuations, such
			amount refunded may be less than the amount paid by the Buyer in the
			Online Transaction, and Alibaba.com shall not be liable to any party
			for any difference in the amount refunded attributable to currency
			conversion costs or exchange rate movements. 3.7 Unclaimed funds
			will be held by Alibaba.com for a period of five years as instructed
			by Alibaba.com, at which time, the Seller will be deemed to have
			waived any claim in respect of such funds or if required by
			applicable escheat laws, we will remit the funds (less any fees, if
			any and to the extent permitted under applicable laws) to the
			relevant competent authority. You hereby agree that upon expiry of
			such period or upon remittance of such funds to the relevant
			competent authority in accordance to the applicable escheat laws,
			Alibaba.com will be relieved of any further obligation to pay those
			unclaimed funds to you. 3.8 You acknowledge and agree that
			Alibaba.com may receive interest for the funds held on behalf of you
			pursuant to Alibaba.com Supplemental Services rendered to you in
			accordance with applicable laws and you will not receive interest or
			other profits in relation to the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services.
			4. Users’ Responsibilities 4.1 All Online Transactions are concluded
			by and between Users only. You shall complete Online Transactions in
			accordance with the Alibaba.com Transaction Services Agreement and
			Alibaba.com Sites’ terms, rules and policies. You agree that you
			will not hold Alibaba.com and our affiliates or agents liable for

			any Online Transaction. 4.2 You agree to give all notices, provide
			all necessary information, materials, and approval, and render all
			reasonable assistance and cooperation necessary for Alibaba.com’s
			provision of the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services. If your failure
			to do so results in any delay in the provision of any Alibaba.com
			Supplemental Services or cancellation of any Online Transaction,
			Alibaba.com and our affiliates shall not be liable for any loss or
			damages arising from such delay. 4.3 You represent and warrant that:
			(a) you will use the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services in good faith

			information and material you provide in connection with the use of
			the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services is true, lawful and accurate,

			products, you have the legitimate right and authorization to sell,
			distribute or export the products using the Transaction Services and

			prior warning needs to be modified or is no longer legally required,
			as the case may be. 4.4 If in Alibaba.com’s opinion, any User is not
			acting in good faith, abusing the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services,
			or in breach of this Agreement, Alibaba.com shall have the right to
			cancel the Online Transaction. 4.5 You as the User shall be solely
			responsible for payment of any taxes, duties or other governmental
			levies or any financial charges that may be imposed on any products
			or services purchased or supplied through the Alibaba.com
			Supplemental Services or otherwise arising from the Online
			Transaction. 4.6 You agree to indemnify Alibaba.com and our
			affiliates and our employees, directors, officers, agents and
			representatives and to hold them harmless, from any and all losses,
			damages, actions, claims and liabilities (including legal costs on a
			full indemnity basis) which may arise, directly or indirectly, from
			your use of the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services or from User’s
			breach of this Agreement. Alibaba.com reserves the right, at our own
			expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
			otherwise subject to indemnification by User, in which event User
			shall cooperate with Alibaba.com in asserting any available
			defenses. 5. Personal Data Privacy 5.1 You agree that we may

			case may be), or expiration of the prescribed time limit as provided
			in clause 3.3(b) of the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services Agreement

			be). Alibaba.com may refuse to process or cancel, without liability
			for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with such

			Alibaba.com’s reasonable opinion, has insufficient information to
			constitute a binding contract. 3.3 Online Transactions Subject to
			This Agreement. An Online Transaction is additionally subject to the
			applicable terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
			Transactional Terms. Seller and Buyer shall complete the Online
			Transaction according to the terms of the online order, the relevant
			Transactional Terms and this Agreement. Seller or Buyer may only
			cancel any Online Transaction in accordance with the relevant
			Transactional Terms. 3.4 Transaction between Seller and Buyer Only.
			Each Online Transaction is made by and between a Seller and a Buyer
			only. Despite that Alibaba.com makes available the Transaction
			Services and, if applicable, may conduct formality review(s) of an
			Online Transaction, Alibaba.com shall not be considered as a party
			to the Online Transaction. Alibaba.com does not represent the Seller
			nor the Buyer in any Online Transaction. Alibaba.com will not be
			responsible for the quality, safety, lawfulness or availability of
			the products or services offered under any Online Transaction; or
			the ability of either Seller or Buyer to complete any Online
			Transaction (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law). You
			agree that you will not hold Alibaba.com and our affiliates and
			agents liable for any losses, damages, claims, liabilities, costs or
			expenses arising from any Online Transactions, including any breach,
			partial performance or non-performance of the Online Transaction by
			the other party to the transaction. 3.5 Payment of Contract Price.
			For any Online Transaction, Buyer agrees to pay the full transaction
			price listed for Online Transaction to the Seller through the Alipay
			website or services of Alibaba.com unless another option is made
			available directly by Alibaba.com on the Sites. When using Alipay or
			Alibaba.com to submit payment for an Alibaba.com Online Transaction,
			payments are (in the case of Online Transaction through Alipay)
			processed through accounts owned by Alipay or one of its affiliates
			and/or a registered third party service provider acting on Alipay’s
			behalf, and (in the case of Online Transaction through Alibaba.com)
			processed through accounts owned by Alibaba.com or one of its
			affiliates and/or a registered third party service provider acting
			on Alibaba.com’s behalf. The funds are received for the Seller in
			accordance with the Transaction Services Agreement. Seller agrees
			that the Buyer’s full payment of the transaction price listed for
			the Online Transaction to Alipay or Alibaba.com (as the case may be)
			constitutes final payment to Seller and Buyer’s payment obligation
			for the Online Transaction is fully satisfied upon receipt of funds
			by Alipay’s or Alibaba.com’s account. In the case the Online
			Transaction adopts Alipay Services, the payment in connection with
			the Online Transactions concluded will be facilitated by Alipay.
			Alipay shall not dispose of any such fund except in accordance with
			Alibaba’s terms as agreed by Seller and Buyer which are set out in
			the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Alipay Services
			Agreement. Seller has requested and agreed that the settlement of
			funds to Seller be delayed as provided in the Alipay Services
			Agreement. By using the Alipay Services, you acknowledge and agree
			that Alipay is not a bank and the Alipay Services should in no way
			be construed as the provision of banking services. Alipay is not
			acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to User’s
			funds and it does not have control of, nor liability for, the
			products or services that are paid for with the Alipay Services.
			Alipay does not guarantee the identity of any User or ensure that a
			Buyer or a Seller will complete a transaction on Sites. You further
			agree that neither Buyer nor Seller will receive interest or other
			profits in relation to the Alipay Services. In the case the Online
			Transaction adopts Alibaba.com Supplemental Services, the payment in
			connection with the Online Transactions concluded will be
			facilitated by Alibaba.com. Alibaba.com shall not dispose of any

			Seller and Buyer which are set out in the terms and conditions of
			this Agreement and the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services Agreement.

			Seller be delayed as provided in the Alibaba.com Supplemental
			Services Agreement. By using the Alibaba.com Supplemental Services,
			you acknowledge and agree that Alibaba.com is not a bank and the
			Alibaba.com Supplemental Services should in no way be construed as
			the provision of banking services. Alibaba.com is not acting as a
			trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to User’s funds and it
			does not have control of, nor liability for, the products or
			services that are paid for with the Alibaba.com Supplemental
			Services. Alibaba.com does not guarantee the identity of any User or

			Alibaba.com’s partners. If there is any chargeback or reversal of
			any payment requested by a payment service partner, Seller agrees
			that Alibaba.com has the right to refund the money so requested by
			the payment service partner without liability to Seller. Alibaba.com

			of such third party vendors may be partners of Alibaba.com and thus
			designated by Alibaba.com to you. Among such designated partners,
			you may be required to agree and accept the terms and conditions of
			their services online within the Sites. You agree that unless
			otherwise arranged between Alibaba.com and you, the buyers and
			sellers on Alibaba.com platform are responsible for arranging for

			damages, claims, liabilities, costs or expenses arising from the
			services of such third party vendors. You shall ensure that the
			third parties comply with Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (as
			defined above). In addition, in case the buyer engages any services
			through Alibaba.com or that any such service is engaged in
			connection with a transaction on Alibaba.com for which the online
			payment settlement will be processed by Alipay, the seller shall be
			deemed to have instructed Alibaba.com to transmit the relevant
			payment instruction from Alibaba.com' system to Alipay's system, in
			order for Alipay to apply the amount payable by the buyer to the
			third party vendor for the services so engaged from the amount paid
			by the buyer to the third party vendor’s account. 3.8 Your Agent. If
			you are required to conclude and complete an Online Transaction
			through an agent e.g. a Seller may be required to engage a qualified
			import and export agent as its export agent, such agent is merely an

			processed through accounts owned by Alibaba.com or one of its
			affiliates and/or a registered third party service provider acting

			acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to User’s
			funds and it does not have control of, nor liability for, the
			products or services that are paid for with the Alipay Services.
			Alipay does not guarantee the identity of any User or ensure that a
			Buyer or a Seller will complete a transaction on Sites. You further

			the payment service partner without liability to Seller. Alibaba.com

			dispute resolution process of the relevant payment service partners.
			However, if the participation in the dispute resolution process is
			subject to additional fees, this will be at your own cost only. 3.7
			Third Party Vendors. You may engage one or more third party vendors
			for the purpose of completing and fulfilling an Online Transaction
			such as the warehousing and logistic service companies, shipping
			agents, inspection agents, insurance companies, etc. Some of such
			third party vendors may be partners of Alibaba.com and thus
			designated by Alibaba.com to you. Among such designated partners,
			you may be required to agree and accept the terms and conditions of
			their services online within the Sites. Notwithstanding the
			foregoing, for all third party vendors, you acknowledge and agree
			that such third party vendors are engaged at your own discretion and
			cost and that you will not hold Alibaba.com and our affiliates and
			agents liable for any losses, damages, claims, liabilities, costs or

			Transactions Between Buyers and Sellers 7.1 Through the Sites,
			Alibaba.com provides electronic web-based platforms for exchanging
			information between buyers and sellers of products and services.
			Alibaba.com additionally provides electronic web-based transaction
			platforms for Members to place, accept, conclude, manage and fulfill
			orders for the provision of products and services online within the
			Sites subject to the terms of the Transaction Services Agreement.
			However, for any Services, Alibaba.com does not represent either the
			seller or the buyer in specific transactions. Alibaba.com does not
			control and is not liable or responsible for the quality, safety,
			lawfulness or availability of the products or services offered for
			sale on the Sites, the ability of the sellers to complete a sale or
			the ability of buyers to complete a purchase. 7.2 Users are hereby
			made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting
			under false pretences. Alibaba.com uses several techniques to verify
			the accuracy of certain information our paying Users provide us when
			they register for a paying membership service on the Sites. However,
			because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Alibaba.com
			cannot and does not confirm each User's purported identity
			(including, without limitation, paying Members). We encourage you to
			use various means, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom
			you are dealing. 7.3 Buyers and sellers accessing or using the Sites
			or Services shall assume the risks of conducting any purchase and
			sale transactions in connection with or through the Sites or
			Services. Buyer and sellers accessing or using the Site or Services
			shall also fully assume all risks of liability or harm of any kind
			arising out of or in connection with any subsequent activity
			relating to the products or services that are the subject of the
			transactions on the Sites. Examples of such risks shall include, but
			are not limited to, mis-representation of products and services,
			fraudulent schemes, unsatisfactory product quality, failure to meet
			specifications, defective or dangerous products, unlawful products,
			delay or default in delivery or payment, cost mis-calculations,
			breach of warranty, breach of contract, transportation accidents,
			the risk that the manufacture, importation, export, distribution,
			offer, display, purchase, sale and/or use of products or services
			offered or displayed on the Sites may violate or may be asserted to
			violate Third Party Rights, and the risk that Users may incur costs
			of defense or other costs in connection with third parties’
			assertion of Third Party Rights, or in connection with any claims by
			any party that they are entitled to defense or indemnification in
			relation to the assertion of rights, demands or claims by claimants
			of Third Party Rights. Examples of such risks also include the risk
			of claims from consumers, other purchasers, end-users of products or
			other third parties that they have suffered injuries or harm from
			their use of the products obtained through the Sites or Services.
			All of the foregoing risks are referred to as "Transaction Risks".
			Alibaba.com is not liable or responsible for any damages, claims,
			liabilities, costs, harm, inconveniences, business disruptions or
			expenditures of any kind that may arise a result of or in connection
			with any Transaction Risks. 7.4 Buyers and sellers on the Sites are
			solely responsible for setting out and performance of the terms and
			conditions of the transactions conducted on, through or as a result

			clause 3.2). 7.5 User agrees to provide all information and
			materials as may be reasonably required by Alibaba.com in connection
			with your transactions conducted on, through or as a result of use
			of the Sites or Services. Alibaba.com has the right to suspend or
			terminate any User’s account if the User fails to provide the
			required information and materials without liability for any losses
			or damages arising out of or in connection with such suspension or
			termination. 7.6 In the event that any User has a dispute with any
			party to a transaction, such User agrees to release and indemnify
			Alibaba.com (and our agents, affiliates, directors, officers and
			employees) from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs,
			expenses and damages (including without limitation any actual,
			special, incidental or consequential damages) arising out of or in

			information between buyers and sellers of products and services.
			Alibaba.com additionally provides electronic web-based transaction
			platforms for Members to place, accept, conclude, manage and fulfill
			orders for the provision of products and services online within the
			Sites subject to the terms of the Transaction Services Agreement.

			seller or the buyer in specific transactions. Alibaba.com does not
			control and is not liable or responsible for the quality, safety,
			lawfulness or availability of the products or services offered for
			sale on the Sites, the ability of the sellers to complete a sale or

			made aware that there may be risks of dealing with people acting
			under false pretences. Alibaba.com uses several techniques to verify
			the accuracy of certain information our paying Users provide us when
			they register for a paying membership service on the Sites. However,
			because user verification on the Internet is difficult, Alibaba.com
			cannot and does not confirm each User's purported identity
			(including, without limitation, paying Members). We encourage you to
			use various means, as well as common sense, to evaluate with whom
			you are dealing. 7.3 Buyers and sellers accessing or using the Sites

			sale transactions in connection with or through the Sites or
			Services. Buyer and sellers accessing or using the Site or Services

			arising out of or in connection with any subsequent activity
			relating to the products or services that are the subject of the
			transactions on the Sites. Examples of such risks shall include, but
			are not limited to, mis-representation of products and services,
			fraudulent schemes, unsatisfactory product quality, failure to meet
			specifications, defective or dangerous products, unlawful products,
			delay or default in delivery or payment, cost mis-calculations,
			breach of warranty, breach of contract, transportation accidents,
			the risk that the manufacture, importation, export, distribution,
			offer, display, purchase, sale and/or use of products or services
			offered or displayed on the Sites may violate or may be asserted to
			violate Third Party Rights, and the risk that Users may incur costs
			of defense or other costs in connection with third parties’
			assertion of Third Party Rights, or in connection with any claims by
			any party that they are entitled to defense or indemnification in
			relation to the assertion of rights, demands or claims by claimants
			of Third Party Rights. Examples of such risks also include the risk
			of claims from consumers, other purchasers, end-users of products or
			other third parties that they have suffered injuries or harm from
			their use of the products obtained through the Sites or Services.
			All of the foregoing risks are referred to as "Transaction Risks".

			employees) from all claims, demands, actions, proceedings, costs,
			expenses and damages (including without limitation any actual,
			special, incidental or consequential damages) arising out of or in

			the Sites shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein. 8.4
			The Sites may make available to User services or products provided
