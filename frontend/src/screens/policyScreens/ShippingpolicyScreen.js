						As a wholesale company, we offer very low prices for
						customers to resell to make a profit. As such, our
						profits per item too are very low. Furthermore, shipping
						the item back to us will generally cost more than the
						refunded item(s).
					</div>
					We offer free international shipping (Temporarily not
					shipping to EU countries) from our worldwide distribution
					centers. If you order more than one item, you may receive
					your items separately depending on which distribution center
					it is coming from. Shipping generally takes 2-4 weeks
					depending on where in the world you are located. Although it
					can take longer depending on the custom's process in your
					country, this is what allows us to keep our shipping 100%
					FREE for you, our customer. - Orders are processed Monday -
					Friday, excluding federal holidays and weekends. - Check
					your account/confirmation email for your tracking number. -
					Buyers are responsible for local duties and taxes at
					delivery in countries where applicable - We are not
					responsible for lost or stolen packages or packages delayed
					by the carrier.
